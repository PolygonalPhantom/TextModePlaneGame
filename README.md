# TextModePlaneGame
A simple console game

# Info
This project is a simple project i decided to start work on because i was bored. Please take into consideration i am not a very good programmer, so thats why i decided to start with this small plane game :).

As mentioned in "main.cpp", you are free to do whatever you want with the code.

To control the plane (^-_->|), you need to use the arrow keys.
